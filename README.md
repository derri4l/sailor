This project uses Python to create a RAG tool that lets you parse large documents and query them as well. This is only intended for study purposes.

## How does it work
Pick a document/note from the knowledge folder. Then the pipline begins:
1. **Chunking** -  The note gets split into overlapping word chunks.
2. **Embeddings** -  Each chunk is sent to OpenAI's ```text-embedding-3-small``` model and converted into a vector.
3. **FAISS Index** -  All vectors are stored in a FAISS flat index in memory.
4. **Retrieval** -  When you ask a question, it gets embedded the same way. FAISS finds the top 3 closest chunks by vector distance.
5. **Generation** -  The top chunks are passed to an AI model as context. The model answers using only what's in the retrieved chunks.

## How to use
1. install dependencies  
```pip install openai faiss-cpu numpy python-dotenv requests```

2. Add your OpenAI key to a .env file:
```OPENAI_API_KEY=key```

3. Run with
```python3 main.py```

## Preview
In this preview i ran the tool against a Victor-Von-Doom wiki which you can find in the knowledge folder.

Q1. What is this note about?
- (I asked this to see if the program could actaully read the context provided)

Q2. What was Doom's superpower?
- (A general and basic question, which is provided in the notes)

Q3. When did Doom get laser vision?
- (Intentionally asked something that never happened to see if it would answer out of context)

Q4. Who did Doom have a soft spot for?
- (A slightly deeper question that requires pulling meaning from context rather than a direct fact)

## Next Steps
- Auto chunk sizing
- implement vector store/database
- TUI
